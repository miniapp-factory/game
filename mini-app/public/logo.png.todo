A stylized 2048 tile logo featuring a bright, square tile with the number 2048 in large, bold, white font centered on a vibrant, gradient background that transitions from deep blue at the top to bright teal at the bottom. The tile has a subtle drop shadow and a slight 3D bevel effect to give it depth. The background behind the tile is a soft, light gray gradient that fades to white at the edges, creating a clean, modern look. The overall composition is balanced, with the tile centered and occupying most of the canvas, making it instantly recognizable as a 2048 game logo.
